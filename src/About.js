        <h5>Hello!</h5>
        <p>
            I'm Patrick, and welcome to my page! I'm a video 
            game hobbyist, developer/programmer and 
            professionally, I work in IT support.
        </p>

            I live in beautiful San Diego, and have lived 
            here my whole life. Here, you can go from 
            the beach to a mountain in less than 
            an hour. I love trying new and interesting
            food, and San Diego has so much unique food.
            I have a favorite Ramen shop, Taco 
            shop, Pho shop, Banh Mi shop, Pizza shop, Hot Pot 
            shop, Korean BBQ shop... honestly I could go on
            for hours.

            I began my working life in different markets and
            industries like food service, hospitality, 
            medical device production... you name it! But, my
            professional career really started to take shape
            in hospitality at SeaWorld San Diego. Here is where
            I developed my people skills. Eventually, I was
            able to move into a leadership position
            and further developed my communication and 
            organizational skills. During this time I made
            a few changes to my major while pursuing my degree:
            I went from Journalism, to Communications, to Economics,
            and finally settled on Computer Science. It made 
            sense to get into tech, because I grew up with
            tech all of my life. While I was in school, 
            my interest in tech led me to a service and
            support role at Geek Squad. Having the ability to
            be empathetic with people and drive conversations
            during computer support sessions with customers 
            is a skill that I carried over from the 
            skillset I used at SeaWorld. During my time at
            Geek Squad, I finished my Bachelor's program
            at Cal State San Marcos. It took me about 
            another year to find a job out of college,
            but eventually I found a role at ICW Group
            in San Diego in IT Support. This role really
            blends the best of both of my two previous jobs:
            Leadership and communication from SeaWorld, 
            and diagnostics and troubleshooting from
            Geek Squad.

            While I was completing my Bachelor's program at
            Cal State San Marcos, I developed an interest
            in software, specifically web development and 
            game design. I figured that if I had the skills
            to apply it to some of the technologies I used
            throughout my life, I would find a career that
            I sincerely enjoy. Currently, I am educating myself
            on the current web development landscape and 
            learning technologies like ReactJS and Node.js.
            I'm also very curious about video game technology
            and how it has evolved throughout the years
            (like Unreal 5's Global Illumination). I enjoy
            the process of figuring out how these 
            technologies work and how they provide us the 
            experiences we have today. I find myself 
            often staying up late at night (like now, 
            as I write this)
            messing with blocks of code, understanding
            React components with Bootstrap, what
            happens when I move a file, and the whole
            development and deployment process.
            These software technologies
            have enough to keep me curious for the 
            rest of my life!

            I've spent a lot of my life playing video games.
            My favorite video games are engaging, immersive,
            and high fidelity. My perfect game does not have
            to be all 3 of those things, but if a game has
            any one of those qualities I will definitely 
            play it, at least once. <em>God of War 
            (2018)</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption 
            2</em>, <em>and Marvel's 
            Spider-Man</em> are some of the most immersive 
            experiences you could ever play, in my 
            opinion. <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Apex 
            Legends</em> are two other games that have kept
            me hooked for years now. Playing games 
            like <em>Detroit: Become Human</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 
            2077</em> on the latest hardware have made 
            me realize the incredible potential 
            video games have as an entertainment medium.

            about me!
